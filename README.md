# Gradient-Based Methods for the Training of Neural Networks

This project is organized as follows:

* The code for the experiments is contained in the jupyter notebooks `experiment_1.ipynb`, `experiment_2.ipynb`, and `experiment_3.ipynb`, respectively.
* The results of these experiments are stored as .csv files in the folder `results`.
* The plots of these results used in the bachelor thesis were generated by the R Markdown script `plot_results.Rmd`.
* The folder `Figures` contains Matlab scripts used to generate additional plots for the bachelor thesis.
